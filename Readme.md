## 🤔 Why Am I Doing This?

Okay real talk.

We're living in the **AI era**. LLMs write code. Copilot finishes your sentences. You can vibe-code an entire app in an afternoon without touching a semicolon.

And I think that's *awesome* — but also kinda terrifying if you don't understand what's happening underneath.

So I went back to the basement. The **foundation**. The thing that built Linux, Python, Git, and basically every piece of software that exists on this planet.

**C.**

No garbage collector. No hand-holding. You want memory? You ask for it. You done with it? You free it (or you don't, and things explode — which is honestly a great way to learn).

Here's why C hits different :

- 🧠 **Understand what AI-generated code is actually doing** at the system level
- ⚡ **Pointers, memory, stack vs heap** — stuff most devs wave their hands at
- 🔩 **Get close to the metal** — like, embarrassingly close
- 💀 **Segfaults build character** (they really do)
- 🎯 **When you understand C, everything else makes sense**

This isn't a bootcamp. There's no certificate at the end. This is just me, a compiler, and a terminal — figuring it out one project at a time.

## 📁 What's In Here

Each folder = one project = one step forward.

Every project has:
- 📄 A `.c` file (the actual code, no fluff)
- 🖼️ A screenshot of it running (proof it works lol)
- A quick description below of what I learned

### 📦 `SimpleFunPass`
**The Simple Fun Way To Generate Passwords..!!**

**What it does:** You give it a number. It gives you a chaotic, beautiful, unhinged password. You're welcome.

**So for project #1**, instead of printing "Hello World" like a boring person, I built a **random password generator** — because security is literally my thing and also because it forced me to actually *use* C concepts right away instead of just vibing with `printf`.

### 📦 `StupidFunEncrypt/` — *The Stupidly Genius Encryptor* 🔐💀

**What it does:** Takes anything you throw at it — text, files, your secrets, your enemies' secrets — and scrambles it with a key. Run it again with the same key? Unscrambled. It's encryption. Stupid, beautiful, raw encryption.

```bash
echo "hello hacker" | ./stupidFunEncrypt mykey
# outputs: cursed gibberish 🗿

echo "hello hacker" | ./stupidFunEncrypt mykey | ./stupidFunEncrypt mykey  
# outputs: hello hacker 👻
```

This one hit different. Because this isn't just a fun program — this is **how real encryption actually works at the bit level**. XOR is literally inside AES, inside TLS, inside every secure connection your browser makes right now. And here it is, naked, in 20 lines of C.

Here's what I learned that broke my brain (in a good way):

- 🧮 **XOR (`^`) is reversible** — `A ^ B ^ B = A`. That's it. That's the magic. Apply the same operation twice and you're back where you started. I knew this from cybersecurity theory. Writing it myself in raw C hit completely different.
- 👆 **Pointer arithmetic** — `*key++` doesn't just read the character, it moves the pointer to the next one in the same breath. No index. No `.charAt()`. Just a pointer walking through memory like it owns the place.
- 🔑 **Hashing the key into a bitmask** — summing up all the ASCII values of the key characters into one integer, then XORing every byte of input against it. Simple. Dumb. Effective. *Stupid fun.*
- 📟 **`getchar()` / `putchar()` + EOF** — the program reads from stdin one character at a time until there's nothing left. Pipe anything into it. Files, strings, whatever. That's Unix philosophy and it's beautiful.
- 🖥️ **`argc` and `argv[]`** — command-line arguments in C, no frameworks, no argument parsers. Just `argv[1]` and trust.

```c
// the line that made me feel like a hacker
while(*key){
    hash += (*key++);  // dereference, add to hash, increment pointer — one shot
}
```

Is this cryptographically secure? Absolutely not 😂  
Is this how XOR ciphers work at the metal level? **100% yes.**  
Did I learn more about bits, memory, and pointers from this than from any YouTube tutorial? **Without question.**

## 🛠️ How To Run Any Project

```bash
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/ykverse/LetsLearnC.git
cd LetsLearnC

# pick a project
cd <filename>

# compile it
gcc main.c -o main

# run it
./main
```

You'll need `gcc` installed. If you don't have it:
```bash
# Linux/macOS
sudo apt install gcc       # Debian/Ubuntu
brew install gcc           # macOS

# Windows: install MinGW or WSL, you'll figure it out
```

## 📌 Ground Rules I Set For Myself

1. **No copy-pasting code I don't understand.** Every line gets read.
2. **Break things on purpose.** Mess with the code, see what happens.
3. **Comment like future-me is confused** (because he will be).
4. **Screenshots are mandatory.** If it ran, it gets documented.
5. **Have fun or what's the point.**
